I presented [a poster](http://jack-fitzgerald.github.io/files/Money_Talks_Poster.pdf) for an experimental proposal to participants in, and numerous guest speakers for, the University of Copenhagen's "Behavioral Economics: Behind the Scenes" workshop. This proposal eventually evolved into a meta-analysis.
