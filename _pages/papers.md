Rains & Richards (2024, <i>PNAS</i>) find that compared to US states that instituted bans on COVID-19 vaccination requirements, states that imposed COVID-19 vaccination mandates exhibit lower adult and child uptake of flu vaccines, and lower uptake of COVID-19 boosters. These differences are generally interpreted causally. However, further inspection reveals that these results are driven by the inclusion of a single bad control variable. When removed, the data instead shows that states which mandated COVID-19 vaccination experience higher COVID-19 booster and flu vaccine takeup than states that banned COVID-19 vaccination requirements.

**Is There a Foreign Language Effect on Workplace Bribery Susceptibility? Evidence from a Randomized Controlled Vignette Experiment** (with [Paul Stroet](https://paulstroet.netlify.app/), [Arjen van Witteloostuijn](https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/arjen-van-witteloostuijn), and [Kristina S. Weißmüller](https://www.ksweissmueller.com/)). *Journal of Business Ethics*, 2024. <br/>

Theory and evidence from the behavioral science literature suggest that the widespread and rising use of <i>lingua francas</i> in the workplace may impact the ethical decision-making of individuals who must use foreign languages at work. We test the impact of foreign language usage on individual susceptibility to bribery in workplace settings using a vignette-based randomized controlled trial in a Dutch student sample. Results suggest that there is not even a small foreign language effect on workplace bribery susceptibility. We combine traditional null hypothesis significance testing with equivalence testing methods novel to the business ethics literature that can provide statistically significant evidence of bounded or null relationships between variables. These tests suggest that the foreign language effect on workplace bribery susceptibility is bounded below even small effect sizes. <i>Post hoc</i> analyses provide evidence suggesting fruitful further routes of experimental research into bribery.

**Manipulation Tests in Regression Discontinuity Design: The Need for Equivalence Testing**. [<i>Institute for Replication Discussion Paper Series</i>, No. 136](https://hdl.handle.net/10419/300277), 2024. <br/>
<small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('rdd-equiv')">Abstract</a> | [Draft](https://jack-fitzgerald.github.io/files/RDD_Equivalence.pdf) | [Twitter/X Thread](https://x.com/FitzgeraldJack_/status/1815334145091920105)] </small>

<div id="rdd-equiv" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>

Researchers utilizing regression discontinuity design (RDD) commonly test for running variable (RV) manipulation around a cutoff, but incorrectly assert that insignificant manipulation test statistics are evidence of negligible manipulation. I introduce simple frequentist equivalence testing procedures that can provide statistically significant evidence that RV manipulation around a cutoff is practically equivalent to zero. I then demonstrate the necessity of these procedures, leveraging replication data from 36 RDD publications to conduct 45 equivalence-based RV manipulation tests. Over 44% of RV density discontinuities at the cutoff can not be significantly bounded beneath a 50% upward jump. Bounding equivalence-based manipulation test failure rates beneath 5% requires arguing that a 350% upward density jump is practically equivalent to zero. Meta-analytic estimates reveal that average RV manipulation around the cutoff is equivalent to a 26% upward density jump. These results imply that many published RDD estimates may be confounded by discontinuities in potential outcomes due to RV manipulation that remains undetectable by existing tests. I provide research guidelines and commands in Stata and R to help researchers conduct more credible equivalence-based manipulation testing in future RDD research.

I introduce equivalence testing procedures that can provide statistically significant evidence that economic relationships are practically equal to zero. I then demonstrate their necessity by systematically reproducing the estimates that defend 135 null claims made in 81 articles from top economics journals. 36-63% of these estimates fail lenient equivalence tests. Though prediction platform data reveals that researchers find these equivalence testing failure rates (ETFRs) to be unacceptably high, researchers actually anticipate unacceptably high ETFRs, accurately predicting that ETFRs exceed acceptable thresholds by around 23 percentage points. To obtain ETFRs that researchers deem acceptable, one must contend that nearly 75% of published effect sizes in economics are practically equal to zero. This implies that Type II error rates are unacceptably high throughout economics. This paper provides economists with empirical justification, guidelines, and commands in Stata and R for conducting credible equivalence testing and practical significance testing in future research.

**The Problems with Poor Proxies: Does Innovation Mitigate Agricultural Damage from Climate Change?** 2024. <br/>
<small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('MS23')">Abstract</a> | [Draft](https://jack-fitzgerald.github.io/files/MS23_Replication.pdf) | [Data & Code](https://osf.io/d7wz9/) ] </small>

<div id="MS23" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>

Moscona & Sastry (2023, <i>Quarterly Journal of Economics</i>) - henceforth MS23 - find that cropland values are significantly less damaged by extreme heat exposure (EHE) when crops are more exposed to technological innovation. However, MS23's 'innovation exposure' variable does not measure innovation, instead proxying innovation using a measure of crops' national heat exposure. A re-examination of MS23's replication data - which permits a close but inexact reproduction of MS23's published findings - shows that this proxy moderates EHE impacts for reasons unrelated to innovation. The proxy is practically identical to local EHE, so MS23's models examining interaction effects between their proxy and local EHE effectively interact local EHE with itself. I document extensive evidence that MS23's findings on 'innovation exposure' are simply artefacts of nonlinear impacts in local EHE, and uncover robustness issues for other key findings. I then construct direct measures of innovation exposure from MS23's crop variety and patenting data. Replacing MS23's proxy with these direct innovation measures decreases MS23's moderating effect estimates by at least 99.8% in standardized units; none of these new estimates are statistically significantly different from zero. Similar results arise from an instrumental variables strategy that instruments my direct innovation measures with MS23's heat proxy. These results cast doubt on the general capacity for market innovations to mitigate agricultural damage from climate change.
