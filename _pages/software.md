**shinyTST** <br/>
<small>[ [Website](https://jack-fitzgerald.shinyapps.io/shinyTST/) ] </small>

A Shiny app for three-sided testing ([Goeman, Solari, & Stijnen 2010](https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.4002)). Shiny adaptation of the <b>tst</b> command in my <b>eqtesting</b> R package. Developed jointly with [Peder Isager](https://pedermisager.org/).

**eqtesting** <br/>
<small>[ [Github Repository](https://github.com/jack-fitzgerald/eqtesting) ] </small>

An R package for equivalence testing. Provides the <b>tst</b> command, which implements the three-sided testing procedure ([Goeman, Solari, & Stijnen 2010](https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.4002)), as well as the <b>lddtest</b> command, which performs equivalence testing on logarithmic density discontinuities at the cutoff for running variables in regression discontinuity design ([Fitzgerald 2024](https://jack-fitzgerald.github.io/files/RDD_Equivalence.pdf)).

**lddtest** <br/>
<small>[ [SSC Package](https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s459446.html) | [Github Repository](https://github.com/jack-fitzgerald/lddtest) ] </small>

A Stata command that performs equivalence testing on logarithmic density discontinuities at the cutoff for running variables in regression discontinuity design ([Fitzgerald 2024](https://jack-fitzgerald.github.io/files/RDD_Equivalence.pdf)).

**tsti** <br/>
<small>[ [SSC Package](https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s459445.html) | [Github Repository](https://github.com/jack-fitzgerald/tsti) ] </small>

An immediate Stata command that implements the three-sided testing procedure ([Goeman, Solari, & Stijnen 2010](https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.4002)).
