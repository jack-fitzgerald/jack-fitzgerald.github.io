I am a PhD candidate in economics at Vrije Universiteit (VU) Amsterdam. I work on issues in applied econometrics, behavioral economics, and methodology. 

Equivalence testing is a major focus of my current research. My working paper, "[The Need for Equivalence Testing in Economics](https://jack-fitzgerald.github.io/files/The_Need_for_Equivalence_Testing_in_Economics.pdf)", provides empirical evidence that null claims made in the absence of equivalence testing exhibit high error rates, and additionally offers practical guidelines and software commands for implementing such testing. I also apply equivalence testing in my empirical work (for example, see my [recently-accepted foreign language effect article](https://jack-fitzgerald.github.io/files/JBE_manuscript.pdf)). 

Further, I do considerable work in replication and reproducibility. I have several substantative comments under development and under invited submission concerning publications in [<i>Quarterly Journal of Economics</i>](https://jack-fitzgerald.github.io/files/MS23_Replication.pdf), <i>PNAS</i>, and [<i>Nature Human Behaviour</i>](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-023-01807-2).

I am positioned in the Behavioral Social Sciences group within the Department of Ethics, Governance, and Society in the School of Business and Economics. I also hold a teaching affiliation at the Department of Criminology in the Faculty of Law. My PhD dissertation, "Why Do Firms Comply?", focuses on behavioral determinants of corporate compliance with public policies.
