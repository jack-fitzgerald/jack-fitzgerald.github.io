I am a PhD candidate in economics at Vrije Universiteit (VU) Amsterdam. I work on issues in applied econometrics, replication, and economics of science. 

My research agenda is dedicated to improving methods in scientific research. My research can broadly be categorized as follows:
* **Equivalence testing and practical significance testing.** [My job market paper](https://jack-fitzgerald.github.io/files/The_Need_for_Equivalence_Testing_in_Economics.pdf) introduces methods that can provide statistically significant evidence that economic relationships are practically equal to zero. In their absence, error rates in top economics journals are quite high. Iâ€™ve also employed these tests in empirical applications, such as my article in Journal of Business Ethics.
* **Robustness tests for causal inference.** I work on methods for testing critical assumptions in causal designs, including [manipulation tests in regression discontinuity design](https://jack-fitzgerald.github.io/files/RDD_Equivalence.pdf) and [hypothetical bias experiments](https://jack-fitzgerald.github.io/files/Hypothetical_Bias.pdf).
* **Replication.** I have reproduced over 120 papers throughout my PhD, and I have [published replication work in <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i>](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2403758121). I have several comments under development and under invited submission concerning publications in in [<i>Management Science</i>](https://jack-fitzgerald.github.io/files/GS22_Replication.pdf), [<i>Nature Human Behaviour</i>](https://jack-fitzgerald.github.io/files/WEA23_Replication.pdf), and [<i>Quarterly Journal of Economics</i>](https://jack-fitzgerald.github.io/files/MS23_Replication.pdf).

I am positioned in the Behavioral Social Sciences group within the Department of Ethics, Governance, and Society in the School of Business and Economics. I also teach at the Department of Criminology in the Faculty of Law. My PhD dissertation, "Why Do Firms Comply?", focuses on behavioral determinants of corporate compliance with public policies.
