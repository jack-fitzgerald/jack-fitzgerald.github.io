I am a PhD candidate in economics at Vrije Universiteit (VU) Amsterdam. I work on issues in applied econometrics, behavioral economics, and methodology. 

Equivalence testing is a major focus of my current research. I document [empirical evidence](https://jack-fitzgerald.github.io/files/The_Need_for_Equivalence_Testing_in_Economics.pdf) that null claims made in the absence of equivalence testing exhibit high error rates in top economics journals. To facilitate adoption, I offer practical guidelines and develop [software commands](https://jack-fitzgerald.github.io/code/) for implementing equivalence testing. I also introduce equivalence testing improvements to standard methodologies (for instance, see [my paper on manipulation testing for regression discontinuity](https://jack-fitzgerald.github.io/files/RDD_Equivalence.pdf)), and introduce equivalence testing to different disciplines through empirical applications (for example, see [my article in <i>Journal of Business Ethics</i>](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10551-024-05731-x)). 

I additionally do considerable work in replication and reproducibility. I have several substantative comments under development and under invited submission concerning publications in [<i>Quarterly Journal of Economics</i>](https://jack-fitzgerald.github.io/files/MS23_Replication.pdf), PNAS, and [<i>Nature Human Behaviour</i>](https://jack-fitzgerald.github.io/files/WEA23_Replication.pdf).

I am positioned in the Behavioral Social Sciences group within the Department of Ethics, Governance, and Society in the School of Business and Economics. I also hold a teaching affiliation at the Department of Criminology in the Faculty of Law. My PhD dissertation, "Why Do Firms Comply?", focuses on behavioral determinants of corporate compliance with public policies.
