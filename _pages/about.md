I am a PhD candidate in economics at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and the Tinbergen Institute. I work on issues in applied econometrics, replication, and economics of science. 

I am dedicated to improving methods in scientific research. My research can broadly be categorized as follows:
* **Equivalence testing and practical significance testing.** [My job market paper](https://jack-fitzgerald.github.io/files/The_Need_for_Equivalence_Testing_in_Economics.pdf) introduces methods that can provide statistically significant evidence that economic relationships are practically equal to zero. In their absence, error rates in top economics journals are quite high. I’ve also employed these tests in empirical applications, such as [my article in <i>Journal of Business Ethics</i>](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-024-05731-x), and in extended methodological applications, such as in my [tutorial on three-sided testing](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/8y925_v3).
* **Robustness tests for causal inference.** I work on methods for testing critical assumptions in causal designs, including [manipulation tests in regression discontinuity design](https://jack-fitzgerald.github.io/files/RDD_Equivalence.pdf) and [hypothetical bias experiments](https://jack-fitzgerald.github.io/files/Hypothetical_Bias.pdf).
* **Replication.** I have reproduced over 140 papers throughout my PhD, and I have published replication work in [<i>Nature Human Behaviour</i>](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-025-02347-7), <i>Journal of Political Economy: Microeconomics</i>, and [<i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i>](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2403758121). I have several comments under invited (re)submission concerning publications in [<i>American Economic Journal: Applied Economics</i>](https://jack-fitzgerald.github.io/files/VEA24.pdf) and [<i>Management Science</i>](https://jack-fitzgerald.github.io/files/GS22_Replication.pdf).

I am positioned in the Behavioral Social Sciences group within the Department of Ethics, Governance, and Society in the School of Business and Economics. I also teach at the Department of Criminology in the Faculty of Law.
