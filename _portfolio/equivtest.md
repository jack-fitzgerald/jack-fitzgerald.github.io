The equivtest R package provides the tst and ROSE commands, which respectively implement the three-sided testing procedure ([Goeman, Solari, and Stijnen 2010](https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.4002)) and compute regions of statistical equivalence for statistical estimates. The full repository, along with download instructions in R, [can be found here](https://github.com/jack-fitzgerald/equivtest).
