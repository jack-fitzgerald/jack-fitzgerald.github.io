title: "US states that mandated COVID-19 vaccination see higher, not lower, takeup of COVID-19 boosters and flu vaccines"

excerpt: 'Rains & Richards (2024) find that compared to US states that instituted bans on COVID-19 vaccination requirements, states that imposed COVID-19 vaccination mandates exhibit lower adult and child uptake of flu vaccines, and lower uptake of COVID-19 boosters. These differences are generally interpreted causally. However, further inspection reveals that these results arise from poor statistical modelling choices. When corrected, Rains & Richards' data instead shows that states which mandated COVID-19 vaccination experience higher COVID-19 booster and flu vaccine takeup than states that banned COVID-19 vaccination requirements.'
